# Live Peers / Seeds

> When you start a node, you often need to connect to the network. This requires you to connect to one or more peers to start downloading the blockchain and receiving new blocks and transactions. Seeding nodes or bootstrap nodes help in this initial connection process.

:::info
Copy and run the commands below to add your peers into `config.toml`.
:::

import LivePeers from '@site/src/components/LivePeers';

export let home = 'babylond';

export let binary = 'babylond';

<LivePeers rpc="https://babylon-testnet-rpc.polkachu.com" home={home} binary={binary} />
