[Babylon](https://babylonchain.io/) â€“  is a Layer 1 blockchain that provides secure Bitcoin timestamps to its transactions. 

Babylon project designs security protocols that scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To this end, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin the asset, Bitcoin the reliable timestamping server, and Bitcoin the blockchain that contains the most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world.

Babylon consists of two innovative security-sharing protocols between Bitcoin and other PoS blockchains:
- Bitcoin timestamping: This protocol sends succinct and verifiable timestamps of PoS blockchains to Bitcoin; and
- Bitcoin staking: Using Bitcoin timestamping as a building block, this protocol allows Bitcoin holders to stake their Bitcoin to PoS blockchains.
