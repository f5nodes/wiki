[Zetachain](https://www.zetachain.com/) is an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain that connects everything: Build interoperable dApps that span any chain, including Bitcoin; access all chains from one place.

It solves the problems of “cross-chain” and “multi-chain” and aims to open the crypto and global financial ecosystem to anyone. ZetaChain envisions and supports a truly fluid, multi-chain crypto ecosystem, where users and developers can move between and appreciate the benefits of any blockchain: payments, DeFi, liquidity, games, art, social graphs, performance, security, privacy, and so on.
