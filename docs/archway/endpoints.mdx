# Endpoints â€” API / RPC / gRPC

> In the Cosmos SDK, the gRPC-gateway translates gRPC endpoints into RESTful ones, enabling users to interact via the REST API. This adaptation is essential for clients that don't natively support gRPC or HTTP2.

> The RPC endpoint enables users to interact with Archway's nodes, querying the node's state and transmitting transactions within the Archway Network.

> The gRPC endpoint enables user interactions with a Archway Node through the efficient gRPC framework. In the Cosmos SDK, this protocol is crucial for state queries and transaction broadcasts.
