# Node FAQ 

If you have questions that you don't know the answers to, read this FAQ:

### When is Archway mainnet planned?

There are no exact dates. The best answer is soon.

### What types of rewards are in Archway?

- Gas Rebates
- Inflation
- Smart Contract Fees

### How are Archway rewards distributed?

- Gas Rebates will be split 50/50 between validators and applications;
- Inflation rewards will be split 75/25 between validators and apps;
- dApps developers to create custom fees within their smart contracts to pay for these costs. These fees are viewed as the total network fee to users and can also be changed even after the contract has been deployed.

### If I have 0 voting power on Validator? 

Usually it happens when your archwayd process crashes. If `archwayd` is not running, restart it:
```bash 
archwayd restart
```
