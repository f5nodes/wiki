# Seeds Selector Example

> When you start a node, you often need to connect to the network. This requires you to connect to one or more seeds to start downloading the blockchain and receiving new blocks and transactions. Seeding nodes or bootstrap nodes help in this initial connection process.

:::info
Select one or more seeds from the table below and use the generated command to add them to your `config.toml`.
:::

import SeedsPeersSelector from "@site/src/components/SeedsPeersSelector";
import { celestiaSeeds } from "@site/src/components/SeedsPeersSelector/celestiaSeeds";

export let home = "celestia-app";
export let binary = "celestia-appd";

<SeedsPeersSelector
  items={celestiaSeeds}
  type="seeds"
  home={home}
  binary={binary}
/>
