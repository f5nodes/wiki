# Endpoints â€” API / RPC / gRPC

> In the Cosmos SDK, the gRPC-gateway translates gRPC endpoints into RESTful ones, enabling users to interact via the REST API. This adaptation is essential for clients that don't natively support gRPC or HTTP2.

> The RPC endpoint enables users to interact with Celestia's nodes, querying the node's state and transmitting transactions within the Celestia Network.

> The gRPC endpoint enables user interactions with a Celestia Node through the efficient gRPC framework. In the Cosmos SDK, this protocol is crucial for state queries and transaction broadcasts.

This page shows only working endpoints that have been verified as operational. The list is dynamically updated each time the page loads. You can also click the Refresh button to check for currently available endpoints.
