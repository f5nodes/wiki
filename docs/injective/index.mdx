[Injective](https://injective.com) is a Layer 1 blockchain that built using the Cosmos SDK, where developers can find robust out-of-the-box modules such as a completely decentralized orderbook that can be utilized to build a diverse array of sophisticated applications.

- Injective is natively interoperable across a number of sovereign blockchain networks while also being IBC-enabled. Injective is able to facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions across Ethereum, Moonbeam, IBC-enabled chains such as CosmosHub, and Wormhole integrated chains such as Solana, Avalanche, and many more.
- Injective supports CosmWasm, a novel smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. This means developers can easily launch their own smart-contract powered applications on Injective. Smart-contracts that work on other chains supporting CosmWasm can seamlessly be migrated to Injective.
- Since Injective supports cross-chain transactions with Ethereum and all IBC-enabled chains, it means tokens launched on Injective can be exposed to multiple networks by default.
- Injective utilize flexible and expressive development environments powered by Rust and Golang.
