[Initia](https://initia.xyz/) is an L1 blockchain on Cosmos with application-specific L2s (Layer 2) using Optimistic rollups. Through Initia's architecture, encompassing the L1, L2, and communication layers, developers can easily launch application-specific blockchains as Initia L2s without needing to know complex chain-level infrastructure or run validator sets.

The Initia L1 is an interoperable network that employs MoveVM, the first integration of the Move Smart Contracting Language natively compatible with Cosmos' Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Furthermore, Initia's architecture enables L2s to utilize EVM, WasmVM, or MoveVM while facilitating seamless messaging and bridging between them. Initia uses a robust economic system to align incentives throughout the entire ecosystem.
