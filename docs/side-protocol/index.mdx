[Side Protocol](https://side.one) is a settlement and value exchange layer for the Bitcoin modular blockchains.

Side Protocol seeks to introduce a modular stack to the Bitcoin ecosystem, enabling dApps to be deployed on Appupsâ€”application-specific rollups, akin to the deployment process in Web2 for apps spinning up their own servers.

Within the Side Protocol, rollups operate on their own execution layer while leveraging the SIDE Chain, a Bitcoin sidechain, as the settlement layer. Appups will have the flexibility to select from various data availability layers to suit their specific requirements.
