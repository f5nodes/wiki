[Xion](https://xion.burnt.com/) is the first modular Generalized Abstraction Layer-1 blockchain that enshrines user experience (UX) at the protocol level. 

XION created Burnt on the industry's most dependable and secure consensus framework (Comet BFT), inter-chain communication protocol (IBC), and developer toolkit (Cosmos SDK). 

Combining the modular design of XION’s meta accounts, their signature agnostic implementation, and XION’s parameterized fee layer
offers a composable, future-proof infrastructure layer. XION simplifies the developer experience and enables a user-centric environment that retins the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology, while significantly lowering the entry threshold for mainstream users.
