[Dymension](https://dymension.xyz/) is a modular blockchain built for RollApps, or application-specific rollups. The protocol has two main functions:
- acting as a settlement layer for RollApps;
- providing a RollApp Development Kit (RDK), a pre-packaged set of generic modules that enable a simple process for building and deploying permission-less RollApps.
