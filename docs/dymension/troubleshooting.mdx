## Error: [grpc]: tcp 0.0.0.0:9091: address already in use

- **Error:** 
```bash
Error: [grpc] failed to serve: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:9091: bind: address already in use
```

- **Solution:** usually this means other node use 9091 port.


Check open ports:
```bash
sudo lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN
```
If the ports are occupied by another node, reinstall the rollapp on the new server with default ports.

Or all the ports the rollapp is using are configurable on this server. The available keys are: `rollapp-rpc-port`, `lc-gateway-port`, `lc-rpc-port`, `rollapp-jsonrpc-port`, `rollapp-ws-port` and `rollapp-grpc-port`.
```bash
roller config set rollapp-rpc-port 6969
```

## Firewall status is inactive

- **Problem:**

On a server with a working rollapp, you need to configure a firewall and open ports 26657, 8545, 1317 (by default).

Check firewall status:
 ```bash
sudo ufw status
```

If we get `inactive`, we solve it below.

- **Solution:**

To allow opening a connection on port 26657:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 26657
```

Reload the firewall service:
```bash
sudo ufw reload
```

Check the status of the firewall:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Similar to other ports:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8545
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow 1317
```

---

## Cannot connect via SSH after configured firewall

- **Problem:**

After opening ports and configuring the firewall, I cannot connect to the server via SSH.

- **Solution:**

Verify OpenSSH installation on your system:
```bash
sudo apt list --installed | grep openssh-server
```

You can skip this step if the OpenSSH server is installed on your system:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

Check the ssh service status:
```bash
sudo service ssh status
```

If it is not `active`, you can start it by running the following command:
```bash
sudo service ssh start
```

To enable the service on system start, you can run the following command:
```bash
sudo service enable ssh
```

It is likely that the server is listening on a different port than the default port 22.

Check which port the OpenSSH server is listening to:
```bash
sudo netstat -ltnp | grep sshd
```
To allow opening a connection on port 22:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
```

Reload the firewall service:
```bash
sudo ufw reload
```

Check the status of the firewall:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

## WebSocket connection closed

- **Error:** logs rollapp have error 
```
WebSocket connection closed
```

- **Solution:**

     - There is an issue with your sequencer.
     - It is necessary to forcefully stop and restart the sequencer. 
     - If you do this through the screen, stop all processes.


---

## Relayer status -> creating channel

- **Error:** status relayer is `creating channel` and logs rollapp have error 
```
Error sending messages
```

- **Solution:**

You can wait. Or search for overide for some context

---

## Node: store is not initialized

- **Error:** after migrate rollapp
```
Node: store is not initialized
```

- **Solution:**

You can't migrate with [resync](https://docs.dymension.xyz/build/state_sync).

---

## Failed to query node status

- **Error:** you have error on relayer logs
```bash
Failed to query node status
```

- **Solution:**

You can wait. Or try to [change rpc](/dymension/troubleshooting#change-rpc).

---

## Change RPC


```bash
nano $HOME/.roller/config.toml
```
- `API_URL = "https://dymension-api.f5nodes.com"`
- `RPC_URL = "https://dymension-rpc.f5nodes.com"`

```bash
nano $HOME/.roller/relayer/config/config.yaml
```
- `rpc-addr: https://dymension-rpc.f5nodes.com`

```bash
nano $HOME/.roller/rollapp/config/dymint.toml
```
- `node_address = "https://dymension-rpc.f5nodes.com"`

---

## Unknown data layer type

- **Error:** after `roller run`
```bash
Unknown data layer type
```

- **Solution:**

Try add archive node to config:
```bash
nano $HOME/.roller/relayer/config/config.yaml
```
- `ARCHIVE_RPC_URL = "https://rpc-dymension-testnet.mzonder.com:443"`


---

## Failed to listen on debug address 

- **Error:** you have this on rollapp logs
```bash
Failed to listen on debug address
```

- **Solution:**

    - You probably run 2 instances of the rollapp. 
    - Choose between screen and systemd. 
    - Stop one of them. 
    - For inexperienced users, it is better to use systemd.

---

## Deleting empty file

- **Error:** rollapp logs get stuck and you have an messages:
```bash
INFO: Deleting empty file: /root/.roller/rollapp/data/dymint/004007.vlog
```

- **Solution:** 

Try restart this.

If you use screen. Stop with `CTRL+C` and start again.

If you use systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart da-light-client
sudo systemctl restart sequencer
sudo systemctl restart relayer
```

---

## RPC client connection failed


- **Error:** you see error on portal after connection to rollapp:
```bash
RPC client connection failed, please try again later
```

- **Solution:** 

It looks like your IP is not responding

Check status node:
```bash
curl localhost:26657/status
```

If you have output `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"node_info":{"protocol_version":{"p2p":"8","block":"11","app":"0"},"id` then all good.

Next step is [check firewall](/dymension/troubleshooting#firewall-status-is-inactive)

If you have output `curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port ...: Connection refused` then restart your da-light client.

---

## Failed to initialize database

- **Error:** you can error on rollapp logs
```bash
Error: failed to initialize database: resource temporarily unavailable
```

- **Solution:**

    - You probably run 2 instances of the rollapp. 
    - Choose between screen and systemd. 
    - Stop one of them. 
    - For inexperienced users, it is better to use systemd.


---

## Availability validation failed

- **Error:** 
```bash
ERROR   share/light     light/availability.go:88        availability validation failed  {"root": "xxxxxxxxxxxxx", "err": "context deadline exceeded"}
```

- **Solution:**

Try restart your da-light client. 

If you use screen. Stop with `CTRL+C` and start again.

If you use systemd:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart da-light-client
sudo systemctl restart sequencer
sudo systemctl restart relayer
```

----

## Node is unhealthy: insufficient funds

- **Error:** 
```bash
ERROR   share/light     light/availability.go:88        availability validation failed  {"root": "xxxxxxxxxxxxx", "err": "context deadline exceeded"}
```

- **Solution:**

You need to request more tokens on your key da-light client. 

This can be [TIA or AVL](https://docs.dymension.xyz/build/quick-start/roller-quick/initialize), depending on your environment.


----

## Flush not complete  


- **Error:** you have error on rolayer logs
```bash
warn    Flush not complete     "error": "failed to enqueue pending messages for flush: no ibc messages found
```

- **Solution:**

Flush not complete error can be ignored if your rollapp is fully functional.

If no try to restart services.
