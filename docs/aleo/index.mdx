[Aleo](https://aleo.org/) is a privacy-focused, zero-knowledge Layer 1 blockchain that combines Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography with programmable smart contracts. With built-in cryptographic proofs called ZK-SNARKs, Aleo allows for hidden but verifiable activity and private transactions. This technological blend provides a robust foundation for secure online transactions and enables developers to build applications prioritizing user data privacy.

As Brennen Schlueter, Head of Marketing at Aleo, articulates, ZK-proofs tackle not only Web3 challenges but also broader internet security and privacy issues.
