# Endpoints â€” API / RPC / WebSocket

> In the Cosmos SDK, the gRPC-gateway translates gRPC endpoints into RESTful ones, enabling users to interact via the REST API. This adaptation is essential for clients that don't natively support gRPC or HTTP2.

> The RPC endpoint enables users to interact with Story's nodes, querying the node's state and transmitting transactions within the Story Network.

> The Cosmos WebSocket allows real-time monitoring of transaction confirmations, block updates, and state changes on Cosmos nodes, while the EVM WebSocket provides updates on new blocks, transactions, and smart contract events for the EVM chain.

This page shows only working endpoints that have been verified as operational. The list is dynamically updated each time the page loads. You can also click the Refresh button to check for currently available endpoints.
