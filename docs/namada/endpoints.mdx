# RPC Endpoints

> The RPC endpoints within Namada's infrastructure serve as gateways, enabling users to interact with Namada's nodes effectively. These endpoints facilitate seamless querying of node states and the transmission of transactions across the Namada Network. They empower developers and users to access real-time blockchain data, execute transactions, and integrate Namada's decentralized infrastructure into their applications or tools with ease.
