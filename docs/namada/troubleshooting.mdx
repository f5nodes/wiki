## Validator is jailed 

- **Error:** `validator tnam1q... is jailed` while running `namada client validator-state --validator <address>` 

- **Solution:**

    Get the current epoch:

    ```bash 
    namada client epoch 

    #output: Last committed epoch: 24
    ```

    Submit unjail txn:

    ```bash 
    namadac unjail-validator --validator <address>
    ```

    :::note
    If your node is not synced, add `--node <ip_address:port>` flag to use RPC.
    :::

    Wait 2 epochs and your validator should be unjailed. To check it, run: 

    ```bash 
    namada client validator-state --validator <address>

    #output: Validator tnam1q... is in the consensus set
    ```

## Cannot bond tokens to my validator

- **Error:**

   ```
   0: The address tnam1q... doesn't belong to any known validator account.
   1: The address tnam1q... doesn't belong to any known validator account.
   ```

- **Solution:** You can add your validator address as an alias to use it in bond txs, etc.
    
    Find your validator address:
    ```bash 
    namadac find-validator --tm-address=$(curl -s localhost:26657/status | jq -r .result.validator_info.address)

    #output: Found validator address tnam1q...
    ```

    Add your address:
    ```bash
    namadaw address add --alias <your_address> --address <your_address>
    ```

    Bond tokens:
    ```bash 
    namadac bond --source <your_wallet> --validator <your_validator> --amount 1000
    ```

## Stack overflow error

- **Error:** `thread 'main' has overflowed its stack, fatal runtime error: stack overflow`

- **Solution:**

    Make sure your node is on the latest version: 
    ```bash 
    namada --version
    ```

    :::note
    The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/anoma/namada/releases).
    :::

    Find cometbft process:

    ```bash
    ps aux | grep cometbft
    ```

    Kill the process:

    ```bash
    kill -9 <pid>
    ```

    Increase stack limit in `namadad.service` file:

    ```bash
    nano /etc/systemd/system/namadad.service

    #then add the line:
    LimitSTACK=ulimit -s 32768
    ```

    Restart node and service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart namadad
    ```
