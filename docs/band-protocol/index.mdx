[Band Protocol](https://www.bandprotocol.com/) â€“ is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts.

Blockchains are great at providing immutable storage and deterministic verifiable computations. However, they cannot access trusted real-world information available outside their networks. Band Protocol enhances smart contract functionalities by granting access to reliable data without any central authority or points of failure.
